/**
 * Parameters to tune the ICP (Instantaneous Capture Point) planner for each robot. The ICP planner
 * is a module that predicts the desired ICP trajectory accordingly to the upcoming footsteps. This
 * is one of the critical modules of the walking controller as the desired ICP is used to control
 * the balance of the robot.
 *
 * <p>
 * There is two different implementations of the ICP planner, which are referred as the old and new
 * planners. Both can predict the ICP trajectory by considering a constant CMP (Centroidal Momentum
 * Pivot) location when in single support ({@link #useTwoCMPsPerSupport()} == false). In this mode,
 * the constant CMP location used in single support is referred as the entryCMP.
 * <p/>
 *
 * <p>
 * When using the new ICP planner ({@link #useNewICPPlanner()} == true), there is the possibility to
 * use a different mode for planning the ICP trajectory. The mode considers for each single support,
 * an initial CMP (referred here as entryCMP) location that is used at the beginning of single
 * support, and a CMP location that is used at the end of single support (referred here as exitCMP).
 * This mode is referred as using two CMPs per support ({@link #useTwoCMPsPerSupport()} == true) and
 * is preferable as it helps the robot moving more towards the walking heading direction. It also
 * helps triggering the toe off earlier, and helps stepping down obstacles. However, it requires to
 * tune some more parameters.
