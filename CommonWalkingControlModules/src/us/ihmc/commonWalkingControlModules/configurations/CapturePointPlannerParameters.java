/**
 * Parameters to tune the ICP (Instantaneous Capture Point) planner for each robot.
 * The ICP planner is a module that predicts the desired ICP trajectory accordingly to the upcoming footsteps.
 * This is one of the critical modules of the walking controller as the desired ICP is used to control the balance of the robot.
 * 
 * <p>
 * There is two different implementations of the ICP planner, which are referred as the old and new planners.
 * Both can predict the ICP trajectory by considering a constant CMP (Centroidal Momentum Pivot) location when in single support ({@link #useTwoCMPsPerSupport()} == false).
 * In this mode, the constant CMP location used in single support is referred as the entryCMP.
 * <p/>
 * 
 * <p>
 * When using the new ICP planner ({@link #useNewICPPlanner()} == true), there is the possibility to use a different mode for planning the ICP trajectory.
 * The mode considers for each single support, an initial CMP (referred here as entryCMP) location that is used at the beginning of single support, and a final CMP location that is used at the end of single support (referred here as exitCMP).
 * This mode is referred as using two CMPs per support ({@link #useTwoCMPsPerSupport()} == true) and is preferable as it helps the robot moving more towards the walking heading direction.
 * It also helps triggering the toe off earlier, and helps stepping down obstacles.
 * However, it requires to tune some more parameters.
