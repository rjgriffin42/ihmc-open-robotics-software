   // The maximum constant jerk is not entered explicitly, but is one for a (third order polynomial) motion from 0 to the maximumToeOffAngle within a time span of "referenceTime". 
   // If the maximum toe off angle, reachible by the maximum feasible jerk trajectory is bigger then the maximumToeOffAngle, it is cut down to that value. 
   // This leads to trajectories that are either performed with maximum jerk and (most of the times) ending at a final toe off ankle of less then maximumToeOffAngle, or (if there is enough time) 
   // they end at maximumToeOffAngle and are performed with a constant jerk lower than the maximum feasible one.
