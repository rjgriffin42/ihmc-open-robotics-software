/**
 * Finds shapes inside a point cloud by partitioning the space using an Octree and performing a modified version
 * of RANSAC using local points inside an Octree node.  By sampling locally, points belonging to the shape
 * shape are more likely to be together.  Based on the Schnabel et. al. 2007 paper [1].
 * <p></p>
 * Input: List of 3D points, surface normal tangent vector, and nearest neighbors.  The sign of the tangent
 * vector does not matter.<br>
 * Output: List of found shapes and points which match them.  A list of unmatched points can also be computed.. The
 * returned parameter for each shape is NOT the optimal set of parameters given the set of matched points.  The index
 * of the model refers to the index of the shape description in the models list provided in the constructor.
 * <p></p>
 * DEVIATIONS FROM PAPER:  The most important deviation is that a bitmap image is not constructed for finding points
 * belonging to a shape.  Instead the results from the nearest-neighbor search are used to find all points which
 * match the shape..  Other deviations are mentioned throughout the code in comments.
