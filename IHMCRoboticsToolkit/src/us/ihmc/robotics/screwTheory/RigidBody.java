/**
 * {@code RigidBody} describes a link which used with {@code InverseDynamicsJoint}s describe a robot
 * that can be used with our screw theory library.
 * <p>
 * This class gathers notably the physical properties of the link and its position in the robot,
 * i.e. its parent and children joints.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Here are a few examples of useful screw tools:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The {@link GeometricJacobian} can compute the Jacobian matrix of a kinematic chain.
 * <li>The {@link SpatialAccelerationCalculator} can compute all the spatial accelerations of all
 * the {@code RigidBody}s of a kinematic chain/tree.
 * <li>Based on the recursive Newton-Euler algorithm, the {@link InverseDynamicsCalculator} computes
 * the desired joint torques {@code tau} from the joint configurations {@code q}, velocities
 * {@code qd}, desired accelerations {@code qddDesired}, and the list of external {@code Wrench}es
 * applied on the system.
 * <li>Other tools such as {@link CentroidalMomentumMatrix}, {@link ConvectiveTermCalculator},
 * {@link CentroidalMomentumRateTermCalculator}, are useful tools for developing whole-body control
 * framework.
 * </ul>
