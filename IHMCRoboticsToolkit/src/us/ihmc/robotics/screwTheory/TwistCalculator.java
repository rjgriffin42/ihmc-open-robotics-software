 * This class is a tool that can be used to compute the twist of each {@code RigidBody} composing a

 * A new twist calculator can be constructed via the constructor
 * {@link #TwistCalculator(ReferenceFrame, RigidBody)}. Every time the system's state is changing,
 * the twist calculator can be notified via {@link #compute()}. Finally, the twist of any rigid-body
 * can be obtained as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #getTwistOfBody(Twist, RigidBody)} provides the twist of any rigid-body with respect
 * to the {@code inertialFrame}.
 * <li>{@link #getRelativeTwist(Twist, RigidBody, RigidBody)} provides the twist of any rigid-body
 * with respect to another rigid-body of the same system.
 * <li>{@link #getLinearVelocityOfBodyFixedPoint(FrameVector, RigidBody, FramePoint)} provides the
 * linear velocity of a point of a rigid-body with respect to the {@code inertialFrame}.
 * <li>{@link #getLinearVelocityOfBodyFixedPoint(FrameVector, RigidBody, RigidBody, FramePoint)}
 * provides the linear velocity of a point of a rigid-body with respect to another rigid-body of the
 * same system.
