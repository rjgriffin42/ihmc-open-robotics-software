#Project Name - val_description
#Maintainer - Jordan Lack - jlack1987@gmail.com

The val_description package contains the files needed to generate an URDF for Valkyrie as well as the meshes for visualization. 

#Usage Instructions
If you don't have ROS installed, shimmy over to [here](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu) and install ROS(you don't need to install all of ROS if you don't want to, but you at least need [catkin](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin)). Once you have done this, clone the val_description repo in your catkin workspace. The URDF is then generated by:
```bash
cd <path_to_your_catkin_workspace> 
catkin_make
```
The URDF will be in the directory <val_description>/urdf

After generating the URDF, you may generate an SDF file by executing the following command from the top level package directory:
```bash
gzsdf print valkyrie_A.urdf
```

You can visualize the frames in RVIZ by:
```bash
cd test
roslaunch VisualizeFramesInRviz.launch
```

To see Valkyrie in Gazebo, execute the following command from the top level package directory:
```bash
cd test
roslaunch ValkyrieInEmptyWorld.launch
```
