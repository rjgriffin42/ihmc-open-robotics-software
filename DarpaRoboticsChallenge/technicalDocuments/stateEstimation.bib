@article{Bortz1971,
abstract = {A differential equation is developed for the orientation vector relating the body frame to a chosen reference frame. The time derivative of this vector is the sum of the inertially measurable angular velocity vector and of the inertially nonmeasurable noncommutativity rate vector. It is precisely this noncommutativity rate vector that causes the computational problems when numerically integrating the direction cosine matrix. The orientation vector formulation allows the noncommutativity contribution to be isolated and, therefore, treated separately and advantageously. An orientation vector mechanization is presented for a strap down inertial system. Further, an example is given of the applica tion of this formulation to a typical rigid body rotation problem.},

Methods involving approximation theory, differential equations, the matrix eigenvalues, and the matrix characteristic polynomial have been proposed. In practice, consideration of computational stability and efficiency indicates that some of the methods are preferable to others but that none are completely satisfactory.Most of this paper was originally published in 1978. An update, with a separate bibliography, describes a few recent developments.},

@BOOK{Featherstone2008,

  author = {Featherstone, R.},
  abstract = {The purpose of this book is to present a substantial collection of
	the most efficient algorithms for calculating rigid-body dynamics,
	and to explain them in enough detail that the reader can understand
	how they work, and how to adapt them (or create new algorithms) to
	suit the reader's needs. The collection includes the following well-known
	algorithms: the recursive Newton-Euler algorithm, the composite-rigid-body
	algorithm and the articulated-body algorithm. It also includes algorithms
	for kinematic loops and floating bases. Each algorithm is derived
	from first principles, and is presented both as a set of equations
	and as a pseudocode program, the latter being designed for easy translation
	into any suitable programming language. This book also explains some
	of the mathematical techniques used to formulate the equations of
	motion for a rigid-body system. In particular, it shows how to express
	dynamics using six-dimensional (6D) vectors, and it explains the
	recursive formulations that are the basis of the most efficient algorithms.
	Other topics include: how to construct a computer model of a rigid-body
	system; exploiting sparsity in the inertia matrix; the concept of
	articulated-body inertia; the sources of rounding error in dynamics
	calculations; and the dynamics of physical contact and impact between
	rigid bodies.},
