Grid Map
======================

Overview
---------------

This is a C++ library to manage two-dimensional grid maps with multiple data layers. It is designed with mobile robots in mind and typical usage including storing local data such as `elevation`, `variance`, `color`, `friction_coefficient`, `quality`, `surface_normal_x`, `surface_normal_y`, `surface_normal_z` etc. It is used in the [Robot-Centric Elevation Mapping](https://github.com/ethz-asl/elevation_mapping) framework.

The storage structure is implemented as two-dimensional circular buffer so the map can be moved efficiently while the data keeps its correspodance to a fixed reference frame. This library builds on the [Eigen] library and provides interfaces and message definitions for [ROS]. Currently, only float data can be stored in the grid map.
