- Atlas model has super low effort limits. Plugin increases effort limits to infinity. This seems to work.
- Multisense topic names are different from the robot. Need remapping
- Force_torque sensors are not handled correctly. 
	https://bitbucket.org/osrf/sdformat/issue/38/force_torque-sensors-not-handled-by
- Multisense joint_states published to /joint_states, not /multisense_sl/joint_states as TF expects
- Multisense TF topic names do not match multisense head
	
General crazyness:
	- SetForce adds force. At every iteration, force is set to zero.
	- ForceSensors are crazy noisy
