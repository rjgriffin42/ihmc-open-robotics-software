 * A Command has to be used when interacting with the {@link CommandInputManager} that represents notably the walking controller input API.

 * Unlike a {@link Packet}, a Command HAS to be garbage free, and to be able to copy the data held in a message through the {@link #set(Packet)} method.
 * When a new {@link Packet} is created and one wants it to be consumed by the controller, the corresponding Command has to be created and registered to the input API.
 *
 * Any implementation of {@link Command} MUST have only ONE EMPTY constructor.
